# Moving Balls

Description: This project creates 10 balls at random positions and of different colours. Half of the balls move from right to left and up to down while the other half move in the opposite direction. If they hit the left wall, they change into black squares with rounded corners and rebound to the right. Once they hit the right wall, they turn back into random colored round balls. 

Installation: You can copy the HTML, js, and css files are preview the HTML in the browser.

Preview: You can preview an implementation <a href="https://prevar.github.io/module2/ball.html">HERE</a>

Roadmap: Future improvements might include deflection of balls when they collide with each other
